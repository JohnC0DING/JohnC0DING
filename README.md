## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome, my name is John Lillistone...

This is my personal GitHub account. This account has been used to document my problem solving practice. I started this practice in May 2021 to improve my
ability to apply algorithmic thinking and knowledge of data types to simple problems. All programs were written in Python because I was not very farmiliar with the Python syntax and functions.

This account is also used for any other practice. Recemtly I familiarised myself with C# .NET by creating a simple calculator and improved my knowledge of interfaces through creating a Delivery System.
