#ðŸ‘‹ Welcome, my name is John Lillistone...

This is my personal GitHub account. This account has only been used to document my small problem solving practice. I started this practice in May 2021 to improve my
ability to apply algorithmic thinking and knowledge of data types to simple problems. 

All programs have been written in Python because I was not very farmiliar with the Python syntax and functions available and wanted to improve on this. Though I have been
coding in Python, I have not been doing this in an Object Orientated way. In the future I will attempt to solve all problems in an Object Oriented manner to familarise myself
with the class and object related syntax.

You can reach me via my email if you wish to do so: JohnWLillistone@hotmail.co.uk
