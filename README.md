## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome, my name is John Lillistone...

This is my personal GitHub account. This account has only been used to document my small problem solving practice. I started this practice in May 2021 to improve my
ability to apply algorithmic thinking and knowledge of data types to simple problems. 

All programs have been written in Python because I was not very farmiliar with the Python syntax and functions available. Though I have been
coding in Python, I have not been doing this in an Object Orientated way. In the future I will attempt to solve all problems in an Object Oriented manner to familarise myself
with the class and object related syntax.
